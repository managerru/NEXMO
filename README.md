NEXMO API Bulk SMS send 

Just download files to your Windows PC.

1. Open nexmo.vbs in text editor, fill your nexmo credentials at fields "api_key =" and "api_secret =". Find "Message = " and type SMS message for sending. Save file.

2. Open nexmonumbers.txt in text editor, fill phone numbers for SMS sending, like in sample. Save file.

3. Just run nexmo.vbs and wait for message "SMS sending complete, please see nexmoresult.txt for log". Your sending complete, see log file nexmoresult.txt .

If you have cellular operators restrictions in country for sending, like a ban for advertising bulk SMS sending. It is possible to solve, but need code upgrade. Contact me at 18reklama@gmail.com .
